The R files and data files in this repository correspond to the decision model developed in the research paper titled “The levelized cost of negative CO2 emissions from various pathways of biomass thermochemical conversion coupled with carbon capture and storage”. The “HTT.data.csv” and “pyrolysis.data.csv” are the training data used to develop machine learning models of biomass hydrothermal treatment and slow pyrolysis. R file “current scenario” comprised code that generates the environmental and economic performance of different activities under the current energy mix (fossil dominant). R file “carbon-neutral scenario”, on the other hand, generates the environmental and economic performance of actions when deep decarbonization has been achieved (near zero emissions).
